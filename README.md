In this repository, i try to visualize data using geopandas to create India Map using dataset from kaggle. I will attached the link at the end of this readme and i already upload that file in this repository already.
The dataset contain the growth of NSDP Per Capita for every States in India from:
- 1996-97 by nominal
- 2000-01 by nominal
- 2005-06 by nominal
- 2010-2020 by nominal (detailed in every year)
- 2000-10 by percentage
